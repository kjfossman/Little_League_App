# Getting Started with Create React App

- This is an app for a local little league organization mainly desined to provide a schedule and team information.  A website for anyone involved or wanting to stay up to date with their local little league.  

## Motivation
- I am currently coaching one of the little league teams in my home town and they do not have their own website. I think it is a useful thing for them to have where they could link it to their facebook page or some other social media.  

## Installation 
- Fork repo and clone to your local machine 


## Usage 
- Run bundle install on the backend (linked in the Language section)
- Run rails s
- Run npm install 
- Run npm start or yarn start 

## Language 
- This app is coded in REACT JS using a rails API for the backend 
- https://github.com/kjfossman/api-for-ll
